# Thank You

Thank you for your time and consideration.  


# Running the application

 - npm install
 - npm run dev

# Testing

 - npm run test
 - I have included the bonus test, but it takes a long time to run.  Comment out the last block in sieve.test.js if you want to skip this one.  All tests are passing.  

# UI

 - I have included a barebones UI using React, Vite, Typescript, and Tailwind


Thanks for taking a look!
